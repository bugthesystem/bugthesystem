• Have a solid technical foundation in distributed computing and storage, including significant experience with most of the following: server systems, storage, I/O, networking, data structures, concurrency, fault-tolerance, scalable runtime systems, and systems software
• Experienced in technical leadership and large-scale architecture that impacted critical projects
• Highly motivated with strong interpersonal skills, experienced to work successfully with multi-functional teams, principles, and architects and coordinate effectively across organizational boundaries and geographies
