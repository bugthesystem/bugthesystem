I'm a programmer who specialized in distributed systems, online features for games and SRE also likes to tackle performance problems alongside a variety of challenges.

I do:
- **Collaborate with teams** on the design and requirements for the online user experiences
- **Build and enhance online services** and APIs with a cloud-native mindset around reliability patterns, and scale-out strategies and emphasize testability, extensibility, and performance.
- **Drive common technology strategy** across departments.
- **Mentor other developers** in delivering great online services and user experiences.
- **Collborate  effectively** in geo-distributed and large multidisciplinary teams
